In this project, I will work with the data set <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales>
This data set contains the sales of 3 branches of a supermarket between January 2019 to March 2019.
We will study this data as if we were in April 2019 and would like to use it to solve a problem.
The problem that I will tackle is the one of understanding customers' behavior:

- Busy times
- Most sold categories of products
- Gender of customers
- Which branch sells more
